There is nothing suspicious in any of the folders at first glance, but upon
viewing all hidden files (with a command such as ls -a), we find a folder in the home directory
called '.flag'. Upon going into .flag, if we ls -a again, we find that there is a file
called '.' Normally, you can't name files '..' or '.', but there is actually a space after
the '.' If we do

    cat .\

we see the flag
