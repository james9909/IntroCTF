So I want you to do a few things:

1. Go through each pixel in this picture, and add its rgb values together into separate variables.
Go from (0, 0) to (0, x), then (1, 0) to (1, x), etc.
Ex: r = all red values, g = all green values, b = all blue values.
2. Add all the values and find the md5 hash of that sum.
3. Go through the picture in reverse and do the same thing.
Go from (0, x) to (0, 0), then (1, x) to (1, 0), etc.
4. Append the two hashes together into one final string, such that final = forward + reverse
5. Find the md5 hash of that final string.
