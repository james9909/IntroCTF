If we listen to the recording, we can tell that it is morse code. If we write down the
long beeps as dashes and the short ones as dots, we can get the morse code.
Running the morse code through an interpreter gives us a bunch of 1's and 0's. This is in binary,
like the problem seems to suggest, and if we decode that, we get the original message.
