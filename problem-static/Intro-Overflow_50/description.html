    <title>Overflow description</title>
    <body>
        <p>To understand what a stack overflow is, let's use a restaurant analogy.</p>
        <p>There are 5 tables at a restaurant, where 1 of the tables is reserved.</p>
        <p>The tables look like this:</p>
        <img src="tables.png">
        <p>Let's say that there are 5 people who want to eat at this restaurant, but none of them are on the reserved list.</p>
        <p>
        There are only 4 available tables for 5 people, so how do we fix this? <br>
        We can easily solve the problem by filling up the 4 public tables and giving the reserved table to the 5th person. <br>
        Now, the person at the reserved table is now the 5th person.
        </p>
        <p>
        We can relate this to a computer program by visualizing a buffer, or a set of tables, with a secret variable being the reserved table. <br>
        If we overflow the buffer, with something larger than it, we will be able to change the special variable, like how we put the 5th person in the reserved table. <br>
