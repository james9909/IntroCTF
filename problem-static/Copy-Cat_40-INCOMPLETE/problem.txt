So this guy in my computer science class thinks that he's a programming god, but all he does is copy Chesley.
For his MKS22 final project, he's made this rock-paper-scissors program, which he claims to be unbeatble.
However, is that really the case? Bring him to shame by winning 100 out of 100 rounds against his ai!
