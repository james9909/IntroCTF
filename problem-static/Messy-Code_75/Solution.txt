The code is obfuscated, and it looks incredibly scary at first to decode.
However, we can note, that at the top, there are a bunch of declarations that tell us that
some functions are being renamed. If we rename them, we can get a much clearer image of what is going on.
The first function turns out to be a caesar encryption, and in the second one,
they are comparing the first input with a certain string that is shifted by 26 (which doesn't do anything)
We don't need to actually input anything, since we know that this string is the flag, shifted.
If we brute force the caesar shift on it, we get the original message.
