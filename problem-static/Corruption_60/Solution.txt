If we look at the header bytes of the docx file, we can see that there is a problem.
A valid docx file has the bytes 50 4B 03 04 at the beginning, and ours has
50 4B 13 37. We can fix the file by using a hex editor and repairing the headers so that 13 37 is replaced with
03 04 (We used bless). If we open the newly repaired file, we can see the flag

corrupt_headers
