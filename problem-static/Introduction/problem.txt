Welcome to IntroCTF! The main objective is to solve problems and get flags to
gain as many points as possible. A flag is a string of text, and upon acquiring a flag, submit it in an answer field, like
the one below. If you are stuck, feel free to look at the hint for the problem, and
you are welcome to use the internet to help you. <br>
