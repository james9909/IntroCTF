There are two ways to solve this problem:

1. Look through each file manually and search for 'flag'
2. Use grep like the problem name suggests and do:

    cat * | grep 'flag'

The '|' allows us to pipe input from cat into grep. Basically, we are getting the contents
of all the files and performing grep on it to search for the flag
