(Trig Review)
Do you know about LateX? Here's a guide to inserting it into HTML
http://www.codecogs.com/latex/integration/htmlequations.php
In summary, insert this in head
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/latexit.js"></script>
And denote the latex parts with <div lang="latex">Sample latex</div>
If you're ok with that, I'll write up the problems in latex.

Answer markup: (Put in as a text disclaimer)
^ denotes an exponent.
sqrt() denotes a sqrt
SPV: Suggested point value (on a 1-10 scale)

1. Bill makes a bet with his friend Will. He has an unfair coin that will land on heads 3/4 of the time.
Bill bets that out of 8 tosses, there will be at most 3 tails. Will bets that there will be greater than 3 tails. 
What is the probability that Bill will win? Give your answer with 3 decimal places.
Ans: .679 (You should strip this of zeroes)
SPV: 4

2. What are the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of (4x^2-1)^5?
Ans: 243
SPV: 2

3. Jack has 3 shirts, 2 pairs of pants, and 373 pairs of sneakers. His parents are worried (that he keeps trying
to make different outfits to wear each day). How many days can he go before he must wear an outfit he wore before?
Ans: 2238
SPV: 1 

4. Let a be the coefficient of x^3 in the expansion of (2cbrt(x^4)-3/(x^1.5))^15. What is the greatest integer 
less than a divided by 1000000?
Ans: 1868  
SPV: 4


Algorithms (Math):
1. What are the last 4 digits of the 10,001th prime?
Ans: 4743
SPV: 6

2. Define a triangle number as a number that strictly ascends, and then strictly descends for the same number of 
numbers. For example, the numbers 1-9 are all triangle numbers, as well as 121, 131, 143, 1258632.
