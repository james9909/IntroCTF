Even though the problem says to get the correct serial, it won't help us get the flag.
Also, we cannot simply type out 'flag' like last time in order to view the flag, since
The program seems to check the length of the guess, but what it actually does is check the length
of the evaluated expression. All we need to do is append a string to the flag such that
the flag length is 24, and we get the flag.

This can be done by doing flag+"11111111111111" (14 1's because the length of the flag is 10)
