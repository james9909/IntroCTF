So my friend has this hotspoot, but he recently salted the password in order to keep out trolls!
He didn't tell me what the password is, but I know that the phrase used to salt the original password
(which was 'hotspoot') is a common english word followed by a number between 10000 and 77777. Additionally, he's given me the md5 hash of the new password, which is '40fef56fc1f0e6730bef88bda20860ea'.
Find the new password!
