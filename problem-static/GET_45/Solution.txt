If we view the source of the website, we can see some debugging information, which
happens to be the login for the flag. However, we do not have any way to actually log in, since
there is no form or input field to enter the credentials into.

The name of the problem suggests that we use a GET request in order to log in.
We can do this by sending a request where username=admin and password=123456
The url will end up looking like:

    www.54.172.126.139/GET/index.php?username=admin&password=123456

Upon logging in, we get the flag:
i_dont_get_it
