James has dropped his wallet and scattered a lot of his coins. A good friend came up and recorded 
where each coin was, and gave this LIST to James. If James starts at a coin he dropped 
where he is standing, what area does his path enclose? (He only travels in straight lines and refuses to cross
over any point where he has been before)
Ans: 6580.5
