Not actually a CS problem! 
Invariance math problem. Suppose a and b are the two lowest terms, first operated on. The new term, A1, is (a+1)(b+1)-1.
This makes the number count 299. Each operation reduces count by 1, so we can repeat this procedure until number count
is 1. If at any point A1 becomes one of the lowest two numbers, along with, say, A2 composed of (c+1)(d+1)-1, they
will be replaced with (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)(d+1)-1. Then, the entire 300 terms will collapse into 301!/1 - 1, or just 301! - 1.
Plug this into your calculator/computational engine of choice, and that will result in approximately 9.212E616.
In other words, 617 digits.
