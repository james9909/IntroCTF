We need to use both an overflow and format string attack to get the flag.
The objective of the attack is not to make it such the number of votes is greater than 50,
but to overflow the result message so that we get the flag.

The programs asks for your name, which immediately suggests that we overflow the name buffer.
After overflowing the name buffer, we add '%x' in order to pop values off the stack until we get to
the actual flag. Afterwards, we can use '%s' to print the flag.

You can also find out by incrementing the number of %x's and ending with a %s.

The final payload is:

    python -c "print 'A'*64 + '%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%x-%s'" | nc introctf.me 11111
