This program is very vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, so let's overflow it!
We want to fill up the buffer with random garbage, and we know the length of the
buffer is 64. The program later compares the value of grade to 100.
We know that the buffer stores characters, and the overflow will write a char to
grade. Thus, we need to find the character with a ASCII value of 100, which is 'd'.
Append this to the end of the 64 character string and we get the flag.

Final payload: (we can do this with python and a pipe, but we can also do it manually)

    python -c "print 'A'*64 + 'd'" | ./overflow
