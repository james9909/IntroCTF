INSPIRED BY CAMSCTF CEREBRUM PROBLEM

If we know a little bit of pokemon and a little bit of linux, we can infer that we need
to run the executable with sudo, giving us the command

    sudo ./woodo

Once we do this, we get a sudowoodo, but in ascii, as well as a note at the bottom.
Looking at the ascii art shows us that some characters that are scattered around are
weirdly placed, and the note at the bottom tells us to get mind f**ked. If we try taking the sudowoodo and
the message the bottom and putting it in a brainfuck interpreter, then we get
the flag.
