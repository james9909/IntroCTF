We can't exactly print out the value of 'flag', since 'print flag' is not a valid expression in
python, so let's try something else.

We know that python eval evaluates an expression, and that the program prints out
what the result of that expression is. So, if we do something that would evaluate the flag,
such as 'flag' or 'str(flag)', we can get the flag.
