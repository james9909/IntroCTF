So I want you to do a few things:

1. Go through each pixel in this picture, and find the sum of all the rgb values.
Go from (0, 0) to (500, 0), then (0, 1) to (500, 1), etc.
2. Take the md5 hash of that sum.
3. Go through every pixel with an even x coordinate and find the sum of all the rgb values of those pixels.
4. Take the md5 hash of that sum.
5. Go through every pixel with an odd y coordinate and find the sum of all the rgb values of those pixels.
6. Take the md5 hash of that sum.
7. Append all of the md5 hashes together in order, and take the md5 hash of that final string.
